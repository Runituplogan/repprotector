                This Refund and Cancellation Policy outlines how RepProtector handles requests for refunds or cancellations of our online reputation management services. By purchasing our services, you acknowledge and agree to the terms of this Policy. We aim to be transparent and fair in our practices, and we encourage you to read this Policy in full before making a purchase.

                    1. All Sales Final
                </h3>
                <p>
                    All purchases of RepProtector&apos;s services are final and not subject to routine refund or cancellation. In other words, once you have paid for a service, we consider the sale complete and non-refundable. Due to the nature of digital reputation management work, once our team begins working on your project or delivers results, the service cannot be undone. No refunds will be issued for services after work has commenced or been delivered. We make this &quot;all sales are final&quot; policy clear at the time of purchase so that you understand upfront that refunds are not guaranteed under normal circumstances.

                    2. Discretionary Refunds and Cancellations
                </h3>
                <p>While all sales are final, we understand that exceptional situations can arise. RepProtector may, in rare cases, consider a refund or cancellation request on a case-by-case basis at our sole discretion. This means the Company reserves the right to approve or deny any refund/cancellation request, and any decision will be made entirely at our discretion. When evaluating a request, we may take into account factors such as:</p>
                <ul className="text-gray-700 list-inside list-disc [&>li]:pl-6 [&>li]:-indent-6">
                    <li>
                        Service Status: Whether the service work has already begun or been completed. (If work is in progress or finished, a refund is less likely since the service has essentially been rendered.)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Timing of Request: How much time has passed since your purchase. Prompt requests (especially before we start work) are more likely to be considered than late requests after service delivery.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Reason for Request: The reason you are asking for a refund or cancellation. We will review if there were any significant issues on our end or other extenuating circumstances described.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Costs Incurred: Any costs or resources already expended by RepProtector in preparation or performance of the service. For instance, if we have already paid third-party fees or spent substantial time on your campaign, those factors will be weighed.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Even if your situation meets some of the above considerations, any refund or cancellation exception we make is purely voluntary and does not set a precedent. Please note that submitting a refund/cancellation request does not guarantee that a refund will be granted. We will do our best to be understanding, but all decisions are final once we communicate the outcome to you.

                    3. Non-Refundable Fees (Third-Party Processing Fees)
                </h3>
                <p>
                    If a refund is approved, be aware that any third-party payment processing fees are non-refundable and will be deducted from the amount returned to you. For example, credit card or online payment processors (such as Stripe) charge fees for each transaction, and those fees are not returned to the merchant even when a transaction is refunded. Because RepProtector does not receive those fees back when issuing you a refund, we cannot include them in your reimbursement. In practical terms, this means the refund you receive will exclude any payment processor fees that were applied to your original transaction. (This aligns with standard industry practice – even in the rare case we issue a refund, it would be the original payment minus processing fees.)

                    4. How to Request a Refund or Cancellation
                </h3>
                <p>If you believe you have valid grounds for a refund or wish to cancel a service, you must submit a formal request to us for review. To ensure we have all the information needed to evaluate your case, please follow these steps:</p>
                <ul className="text-gray-700 list-inside list-disc [&>li]:pl-6 [&>li]:-indent-6">
                    <li>
                        Contact Us in Writing: Send an email to support@repprotectors.com with the subject line &quot;Refund/Cancellation Request – [Your Name/Project]&quot;. In the body of the email, clearly state that you are requesting a refund or cancellation and include a brief explanation of the circumstances.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Include Essential Details: Provide your full name (or the name of the account/organization that purchased the service), your contact information, and any relevant purchase details. Helpful details to include are: the invoice number or order ID, date of purchase, and a description of the service purchased. Also, tell us the reason you are requesting a refund or cancellation, with any supporting facts or documentation if available. The more information you provide, the more quickly and fairly we can review your request.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Submit Within a Reasonable Time: It&apos;s best to submit your refund/cancellation request as soon as possible after the issue arises. Requests that come in long after the purchase or after significant work has been completed will be less likely to qualify for consideration.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Once we receive your request, we will confirm receipt and begin a review. Please note again that sending a request does not guarantee a refund — it simply initiates our review process.

                    5. Review and Response Timeline
                </h3>
                <p>
                    RepProtector will review your refund or cancellation request promptly and aim to respond with a decision in a timely manner. In most cases, you can expect an initial response from us within 5–7 business days of your request. If the matter is complex or requires additional investigation, it may take a bit longer, but we will keep you informed if more time is needed. We appreciate your patience during this review period.
                </p>
                <ul className="text-gray-700 list-inside list-disc [&>li]:pl-6 [&>li]:-indent-6">
                    <li>
                        If Your Request is Approved: We will notify you via email that your refund or cancellation has been approved. For refunds, we will process the payment back to your original payment method. Please be aware that it may take several business days for the refunded amount to appear in your account, depending on your bank or credit card provider. Remember that the refund amount will have any applicable processing fees deducted, as explained above. For service cancellations, we will confirm what work (if any) will be halted and whether any partial credit or refund is due.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If Your Request is Denied: We will send you an email explaining that we are unable to grant the refund or cancellation, including the reason for the decision. We understand this may be disappointing, but we assure you the decision was made in line with our policy and after careful consideration of your case. Even if a refund is denied, we will remain committed to working with you to address any service concerns within the scope of the original purchase.

                    By completing a purchase with RepProtector, you indicate that you agree to and accept this Refund and Cancellation Policy as part of our Terms of Service.

We encourage you to review this page periodically to stay informed of any updates. Your continued use of our services after a policy update will signify your acceptance of the revised terms.
