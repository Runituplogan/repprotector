All content and services on the RepProtector website are provided in good faith for general information purposes.

                <p>
                    RepProtector is not a law firm, financial advisor, or medical provider. Any information, guidance, or suggestions provided by our website or team are for general informational purposes related to online reputation management and do not constitute legal, financial, or medical advice. You should not interpret any content on our site or communications from us as professional advice in these areas.

                    2. No Guarantee of Results
                </h3>
                <p>We strive to help improve your online reputation, but RepProtector cannot guarantee any specific results or outcomes from the use of our services. Online platforms and search engines operate independently; as such, results will vary for each user. In particular, we do not guarantee:</p>
                <ul className="text-gray-700 list-inside list-disc [&>li]:pl-6 [&>li]:-indent-6">
                    <li>
                        Removal of Reviews or Content: While we assist in disputing negative reviews or requesting content removal, we do not guarantee the removal or modification of any review, comment, rating, or other content on third-party platforms. The decision to remove or alter user-generated content lies solely with the platform's administrators and policies, not with RepProtector.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Search Result Changes: We cannot and do not guarantee specific improvements in search engine rankings or visibility of any particular piece of content. Search results are governed by complex algorithms and independent decisions of search engine providers. Due to the volatile nature of these algorithms and platform rules, no outcome (such as higher rankings or suppression of negative results) is assured.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Any Particular Outcome: Apart from the examples above, no particular outcome or level of success is promised. All testimonials or examples (if any are provided on our site) are illustrative of past scenarios and not indicative of guaranteed future results. Your success in managing your online reputation depends on many factors outside our control, including the actions of others and the policies of third-party services.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Results may vary widely. By using RepProtector, you acknowledge that there are inherent uncertainties in online reputation management, and no service can promise a specific result or resolution. Past performance is not a guarantee of future results. We encourage you to maintain realistic expectations and understand that engaging our services means you accept the risk that the outcome may not meet your desired goals.

                    3. Third-Party Platforms
                </h3>
                <p>RepProtector works directly with third-party platforms (such as Google, Yelp, Facebook, TripAdvisor, and others) to address your online reviews and content. It is important to understand our relationship (or lack thereof) with these entities:</p>
                <ul className="text-gray-700 list-inside list-disc [&>li]:pl-6 [&>li]:-indent-6">
                    <li>
                        No Affiliation or Endorsement: RepProtector is an independent service provider. We are not part of, affiliated with, or endorsed by Google, Yelp, Facebook/Meta, TripAdvisor, or any other third-party platform. All trademarks, service marks, and logos belonging to any third-party platforms (e.g., Google™, Yelp™, Facebook™, etc.) are the property of their respective owners, and use of those names on our site is for reference only. Our use of platform names or logos does not imply any partnership, sponsorship, or endorsement by them.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        No Control Over Platforms: We do not control the actions, decisions, or policies of any third-party website or service. When we assist you (for example, by submitting a review dispute or appeal), we are essentially facilitating a request under that platform's own rules. Final decisions about content (such as whether a review violates policy and should be removed) are made by the platform and are beyond our control. We cannot guarantee that a platform will respond to or act on any request in a particular way, or within any given timeframe.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Platform Policies Apply: All third-party platforms have their own terms of service, community guidelines, and content policies. Our interventions on your behalf must comply with those policies. You are subject to the terms and conditions of those third-party sites when using their services. For example, if we help dispute a Google review, Google's policies and processes will govern how that dispute is handled. We cannot circumvent or override any platform's rules or requirements.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        No Special Privileges: RepProtector does not have any special agreements or insider influence that would allow us to bypass standard procedures. We use the same public-facing channels and dispute mechanisms available to any user.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    By using our services, you acknowledge the inherent risks and lack of guaranteed outcomes when dealing with independent third-party platforms. The platforms may reject appeals, change their policies, or take actions (or no action) that we cannot predict or prevent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In summary, any assistance we provide with third-party platforms is offered on a best-effort basis. We will advocate on your behalf and utilize our expertise with these platforms, but we make no promises on behalf of these third parties. RepProtector is not liable for the decisions or actions of any external platform, including any refusal to remove content or any changes in their services that affect your online information.

                </p>

                    You are solely responsible for evaluating the information provided and how you implement any suggestions or advice in managing your online reputation. If you choose to rely on any information from RepProtector, you acknowledge that you do so voluntarily and with an understanding that you assume all responsibility for any consequences.

                    7. Limitation of Liability
                </h3>
                <p>
                    To the fullest extent permitted by law, RepProtector and its affiliates, owners, employees, and agents shall not be liable for any damages arising out of or in connection with your use of our website or services. This includes no liability for any indirect, special, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to losses such as lost profits, lost revenue, lost business opportunities, loss of data, or loss of goodwill. We are not liable for any cost of procurement of substitute services or for any matter beyond our reasonable control.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In particular, RepProtector will not be responsible for any loss or damage resulting from: the actions or decisions of third-party platforms (e.g., a platform's refusal to remove a review or a change in their algorithm that impacts your content), your reliance on any information obtained through our site, unauthorized access to our servers or any personal data, or any other intangible losses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If, notwithstanding the above, RepProtector is found liable to you for any claim or cause of action, our maximum aggregate liability will be strictly limited to the amount (if any) you have paid to us for the service(s) related to that claim. If you have received our services free of charge, or if the applicable law does not allow the limitation of liability to the amount paid, then other legal remedies might be available to you to the minimum extent allowed by law.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages, so some of the above limitations may not fully apply to you. In such jurisdictions, our liability will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law, and all other disclaimers and limitations remain in full force. This limitation of liability applies regardless of the legal theory under which damages are sought (contract, tort, or otherwise), and even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.
