            Payment Information: If you purchase services or subscriptions, payment details (such as credit card number, expiration date, and billing address) will be collected and processed securely by our third-party payment processor, Stripe.

          <li>
            What Are Cookies? Cookies are small text files placed on your device when you visit a website. They help the site remember your preferences and activity either for a single visit (using a "session cookie") or for repeat visits (using a "persistent cookie"). We also may use related technologies like web beacons or pixels that work with cookies to collect information.
          </li>
          <li>
            How We Use Cookies: We use cookies to enable certain site functionality, remember your preferences, and improve our services. For example, we use analytics cookies to understand how users navigate our site and to identify areas for improvement. Specifically, we use third-party analytics services such as Google Analytics. Google Analytics may set its own cookies to collect information about your interactions with our site (such as pages visited, time spent on pages, and referring website) and report website trends to us. This analytics data helps us improve the platform and user experience.
          </li>
          <li>
            Third-Party Tracking: Besides analytics, other third-party tools we use (for example, embedded videos or social media widgets) might set cookies to collect usage information. We do not have control over third-party cookies, which are governed by the privacy policies of those providers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Your Choices for Cookies: Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser settings to decline cookies or alert you when a cookie is being placed. Please note that if you disable or delete cookies, some features of our site may not function properly. For example, certain preferences might not be saved, or some pages might not display correctly.

          <li>
            Providing and Improving Services: We use your information to operate our website and deliver the services you request.

          <li>
            Processing Payments: If you make a purchase or subscription, we use payment information to process the transaction (through Stripe) and to handle billing. For example, we'll use your provided payment details to charge for services and send you receipts or notifications about the transaction.
          </li>
          <li>
            Improving and Personalizing our Platform: We analyze usage data (from cookies and analytics tools) to understand how our website and services are used.

It also enables us to personalize content for you, such as customizing certain pages or remembering your preferences.
          </li>
          <li>
            Marketing and Promotions (Optional): With your consent or as otherwise permitted, we may use your contact information to inform you about new features, services, promotions, or other news about RepProtector that might interest you.

          </li>
          <li>
            Legal and Security Purposes: We may use personal information as necessary to enforce our Terms of Service or other agreements, to protect the rights and safety of our users, customers, or the public, and to detect or prevent fraud and abuse. Additionally, if required, we may use information to comply with applicable laws and regulations or respond to lawful requests from authorities.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>We will only use your personal information for the purposes we have described above. If we need to use your information for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you (and if required, seek your consent) before doing so.</p>

        <h3 className="text-base font-bold md:text-lg">
          4. How We Share or Disclose Information
        </h3>
        <p>We understand the importance of your personal information and do not sell or rent your data to third parties. We only share your information in limited circumstances, as described below, and always with appropriate protections:</p>
        <ul className="text-gray-700 list-inside list-disc [&>li]:pl-6 [&>li]:-indent-6">
          <li>
            Service Providers: We share information with trusted third-party service providers who perform services on our behalf to support our operations. These include: Payment Processor (we use Stripe to handle payment transactions), Analytics Providers (we use Google Analytics and similar analytics tools), Email/Communication Tools (third-party platforms to send emails or manage communications), and Other Vendors (companies or individuals for services such as website hosting, data storage, marketing assistance, or technical support). These service providers are given access only to the information necessary to perform their functions and are contractually obligated to protect it and use it only for the purposes we specify.
          </li>
          <li>
            Business Transfers: If the Company is involved in a merger, acquisition, sale of assets, or other business transaction, your personal information may be transferred to the successor or new owner as part of that deal. In such cases, we will ensure that the new owner is bound by privacy obligations consistent with this policy, and we will notify you (for example, via a notice on our website) of any change in data control.
          </li>
          <li>
            Legal Compliance and Protection: We may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, subpoena, or court order; (ii) protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of RepProtector, our customers, or others; (iii) investigate or assist in preventing any violation of law or this Privacy Policy or our Terms of Service; or (iv) respond to an emergency that we believe in good faith requires us to disclose information to assist in preventing death or serious bodily injury.
          </li>
          <li>
            With Your Consent: Aside from the cases above, if we ever need to share your information for any other purpose, we will do so only with your explicit consent. For instance, if you provide a testimonial or case study and agree to have it published, we might share your name or feedback publicly – but only with your permission.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Importantly, we do not share your personal information with any third parties for their own marketing or advertising purposes, and we do not sell personal data. Any third parties that process your data on our behalf are held to strict confidentiality and security obligations.</p>

        <h3 className="text-base font-bold md:text-lg">
          5. Data Security
        </h3>
        <p>We take the security of your personal information seriously. We implement appropriate technical, administrative, and physical security measures designed to protect your data from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. These measures include:</p>
        <ul className="text-gray-700 list-inside list-disc [&>li]:pl-6 [&>li]:-indent-6">
          <li>
            Encryption: Our website uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS) technology to encrypt data transmitted between your browser and our servers. This means that any information you submit (such as form entries or payment details) is protected in transit from eavesdropping.
          </li>
          <li>
            Access Controls: We limit access to personal information to employees, contractors, and service providers who need to know that information in order to operate, develop, or improve our services. Those with this access are bound by confidentiality obligations.
          </li>
          <li>
            Security Practices: We maintain up-to-date security software and protocols to prevent unauthorized system access. Our servers are protected by firewalls and monitoring for potential vulnerabilities or breaches. We also regularly review our information collection, storage, and processing practices to guard against unauthorized access.
          </li>
          <li>
            Third-Party Security: When using third-party service providers (like Stripe or hosting providers), we choose reputable companies that employ their own robust security measures to safeguard personal data.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>While we strive to protect your information, please understand that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Thus, we cannot guarantee absolute security. You share information with us at your own risk, and it is important that you also take precautions (such as choosing strong passwords and keeping them confidential). If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you suspect a vulnerability or that your account has been compromised), please contact us immediately so we can take appropriate action.</p>

      <article className="my-[3.5rem]">
        <h3 className="text-base font-bold md:text-lg">
          6. Data Retention
        </h3>
        <p>We retain personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. In practice, this means:</p>
        <ul className="text-gray-700 list-inside list-disc [&>li]:pl-6 [&>li]:-indent-6">
          <li>
            Active Accounts: If you have an account with us or are using our services, we will keep your personal information on record for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you with our services. This allows us to maintain your account, provide customer support, and carry out the functions you expect from our platform.
          </li>
          <li>
            Business Operations and Legal Obligations: Even after you stop using our services or close your account, we may retain certain personal information for legitimate business purposes or to comply with legal obligations. For example, we might retain payment transaction records for accounting/tax purposes, or to resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, or prevent fraud. We limit access to such data and will keep it only for the period necessary to fulfill those purposes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Deletion of Data: If we receive a verifiable request to delete your personal information (and such request is within our ability to honor under applicable law – see Your Rights and Choices below), we will make reasonable efforts to remove your personal data from our records. However, note that complete removal may not be immediate or may not be possible if we are required to keep certain data (for example, for legal compliance or archival backup systems). In any case, retained data remains subject to this Privacy Policy.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once we have no ongoing legitimate need to retain your personal information, we will either securely delete it, anonymize it (so it can no longer be associated with you), or if deletion/anonymization is not feasible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), we will securely store your information and isolate it from further use until deletion is possible.</p>

          7. Your Rights and Choices
        </h3>
        <p>We want you to be aware of your rights regarding your personal information and the choices you have in controlling it. However, please note that at this time we do not have an automated process or dedicated portal for user-initiated data deletion or opt-out of certain data practices. We will outline the options you do have and the steps we are taking to respect your privacy rights:</p>
        <ul className="text-gray-700 list-inside list-disc [&>li]:pl-6 [&>li]:-indent-6">
          <li>
            Access and Update: You have the right to access the personal information we hold about you and to request corrections or updates if it is inaccurate or outdated. You can typically review and edit basic information by logging into your account (if you have one) or by contacting us directly with your request to update your details.
          </li>
          <li>
            Deletion of Data: You may request that we delete the personal information we have collected about you. While we currently do not offer a self-service deletion mechanism on our website, you can contact us to request deletion. We will evaluate such requests on a case-by-case basis and delete your information provided we have no legal obligation or overriding business need to retain it. Please understand that we are a small organization and are still developing our data management processes; thus, fulfilling deletion requests may take some time and may be subject to any legal requirements or exemptions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Opt-Out of Communications: If we send you promotional emails, you have the choice to opt out. You can unsubscribe from marketing or newsletter emails at any time by clicking the "unsubscribe" link in those emails or by contacting us. Even if you opt out of promotional messages, we may still send you transactional or service-related communications (such as account notifications or billing receipts) as those are necessary for our services.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cookies Preferences: As described in the Cookies and Tracking section, you can control or block cookies through your browser settings. You can also opt out of Google Analytics data collection specifically by using the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on. Adjusting cookie settings is a way to exercise choice over certain tracking.
          </li>
          <li>
            No Sale of Personal Data: We do not sell your personal information. Therefore, there is no need for an opt-out to prevent data selling (for example, as would be required under laws like the California Consumer Privacy Act if we were selling data).
          </li>
          <li>
            Applicable Privacy Rights: Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have additional rights under specific privacy laws. For example, Tennessee residents may have certain rights under the Tennessee Information Protection Act (TIPA), and residents of other states (such as California or Virginia) may have rights under their respective state privacy laws. These rights can include the right to know what personal data is collected, to request access to or deletion of your data, to correct inaccuracies, or to opt out of targeted advertising or profiling. We respect any applicable rights under such laws. If you are a resident of a state or country that grants you legal data rights, you may contact us to exercise those rights. Because our platform currently lacks an automated process for handling such requests, we will handle any valid requests manually and in accordance with applicable law.
          </li>
          <li>
            No Discrimination: We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your privacy rights. For instance, if you request deletion or opt out of marketing, we will not deny you services or provide a different level of service as a result.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please note: Since we are a U.S.-based company in Tennessee, our primary focus is compliance with U.S. federal and state privacy laws. If you are accessing our services from outside the United States, be aware that your information will be transferred to and processed in the U.S., which may have different data protection laws than your country. By using our site, you consent to your information being processed in the U.S. in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p>As our company grows and relevant privacy regulations evolve, we will work to improve our systems for managing user data and honoring privacy rights. We appreciate your understanding and encourage you to reach out with any questions or concerns about your data.</p>

        <h3 className="text-base font-bold md:text-lg">
          8. Compliance with Laws
        </h3>
        <p>We are committed to complying with all applicable privacy laws and regulations in the United States, including federal law and relevant state laws:</p>
        <ul className="text-gray-700 list-inside list-disc [&>li]:pl-6 [&>li]:-indent-6">
          <li>
            U.S. Privacy Laws: We adhere to applicable U.S. federal privacy requirements. For example, we comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) by not collecting information from children under 13. We also follow guidelines set by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regarding fair information practices and data security. If we engage in email communications, we abide by the CAN-SPAM Act by providing recipients with the ability to opt out of marketing emails.
          </li>
          <li>
            State Laws (including Tennessee): We strive to meet the obligations of emerging state privacy laws. In particular, as a company based in Tennessee, we are aware of and aim to comply with the Tennessee Information Protection Act (TIPA) and any regulations promulgated under it. TIPA (effective July 1, 2025) provides Tennessee residents with specific rights regarding their personal information (such as rights to access, correct, delete, and opt out of certain processing of personal data). We are taking steps to align our practices with TIPA's requirements to the extent they apply to our operations. Additionally, we intend to comply with other state privacy laws that may apply to us, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)/California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), Virginia's Consumer Data Protection Act, and similar laws in Colorado, Utah, etc., if and when those laws are applicable to our business.
          </li>
          <li>
            Scope of Compliance: Many of these state privacy laws have thresholds or scope limitations (for example, they might apply only to businesses above a certain size or handling personal data of a certain number of residents). While our current business may not meet all thresholds for mandatory compliance, we voluntarily commit to respecting your privacy and will honor legitimate requests in the spirit of these laws. We continuously monitor legal developments in privacy and will update our practices as needed to maintain compliance.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>In summary, we are dedicated to handling personal information in accordance with applicable law and best practices. If you have any questions about our legal compliance or whether a specific law applies to your data, please contact us and we will be happy to provide more information.</p>
