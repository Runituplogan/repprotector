                    1. Introduction
                </h3>
                <p>
                    RepProtector LLC is a Tennessee-based online reputation management company. This Service Level Agreement (SLA) Policy outlines our commitments to clients regarding response times, service delivery timelines, availability, and the scope and limitations of our services. Our goal is to set clear expectations without overpromising on deliverables or timelines. By engaging our services, you acknowledge and agree to the following terms and understand that while we strive for excellence, outcomes are not guaranteed.

                    2. Response Times
                </h3>
                <p>
                    We pride ourselves on being responsive to client inquiries and support requests. Our typical and maximum response times are:
                </p>
                <ul className="text-gray-700 list-inside list-disc [&>li]:pl-6 [&>li]:-indent-6">
                    <li>
                        Standard Response: We aim to respond to all customer inquiries within one (1) business day during normal business conditions. This includes replies to emails, phone calls, or support tickets made during our business hours.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Extended Response: During periods of high workload or exceptional circumstances, responses may be delayed. In such cases, it may take up to 1–2 weeks to receive a reply. We will always strive to acknowledge your inquiry as soon as possible and appreciate your patience if our response is slower than usual due to heavy demand.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Please note: Business days are defined as Monday through Friday during our stated business hours (see Business Hours below). Inquiries sent outside of business hours will be considered received on the next business day. We will address requests in the order they are received and based on urgency. If a question or issue requires in-depth research or coordination with third parties, our initial response might be an acknowledgment while we work on a full resolution.

                    3. Service Timelines and Delivery
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Projected timelines for our services (such as content removal attempts, review management actions, or other reputation improvement tasks) are discussed and agreed upon during the client onboarding call or in initial project planning. These timelines are estimates meant to guide the process and set mutual expectations – they are not guaranteed deadlines.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While we make every effort to meet the estimated timeframes, actual delivery may vary due to various factors. For example, the complexity of a case, the availability of required information or documentation from the client, and the responsiveness of third-party platforms can all influence how long a service takes to complete. If we anticipate a significant delay or deviation from the discussed schedule, we will inform you as soon as possible and provide an updated timeline or alternative solution. Our commitment is to transparency and keeping you updated on the progress of your campaign or project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Important: Any timeline discussed is a good-faith estimate. This SLA Policy does not constitute a promise that services will be completed by a specific date. We cannot be held liable for delays when factors beyond our control contribute to longer delivery times (see Third-Party Dependencies below). By understanding this, clients can plan accordingly and maintain realistic expectations about the pace of reputation management efforts.

                    4. Business Hours and Availability
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Our team operates during regular business hours of 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM Central Time (CT), Monday through Friday. These hours reflect our availability for routine communications, work on projects, and support.
                </p>
                <ul className="text-gray-700 list-inside list-disc [&>li]:pl-6 [&>li]:-indent-6">
                    <li>
                        After-Hours Inquiries: Requests or messages received outside of our standard business hours (including weekends and U.S. federal holidays) will be acknowledged or addressed on the next business day. We do not guarantee any responses or action outside of our normal operating hours.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Observances: We recognize major national holidays and may be closed or have limited availability during those times. We will notify clients in advance if a holiday closure might impact response times or project work.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    During business hours, we strive to be accessible and to work diligently on all active client projects. If you require a scheduled meeting or call, we will arrange it during these hours at a mutually convenient time. Any work or support needed beyond these hours would be by special arrangement only and may be subject to additional fees or an amended agreement.

                    5. Third-Party Dependencies
                </h3>
                <p>
                    RepProtector&apos;s services often involve interaction with or reliance on third-party platforms that we do not own or control. These can include, for example, search engines (such as Google), online review sites (such as Yelp, Google Business Profile, TripAdvisor, etc.), social media platforms, news or blog websites, and other external online services. While we work within the frameworks of these platforms to improve your online reputation, it is important to understand our lack of control over them:
                </p>
                <ul className="text-gray-700 list-inside list-disc [&>li]:pl-6 [&>li]:-indent-6">
                    <li>
                        Platform Policies and Changes: Third-party platforms have their own policies, terms of service, and algorithms which can change without notice. Such changes may affect the outcomes of our services (for instance, a search engine algorithm update might impact search results ranking, or a review site&apos;s policy might affect whether certain content can be removed or altered). We are not responsible for these independent changes or the impact they may have on your campaign.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        No Control Over Decisions: The decision to modify or remove content (such as deleting a review or taking down an article) ultimately lies with the third-party site&apos;s administrators or policies. RepProtector can request removals or recommend changes, but we cannot force an external platform to take action. For example, if we submit a content removal request to Google or a social network, the final decision rests with that platform.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Availability and Downtime: The performance and uptime of third-party services are outside our control. If a platform experiences downtime or technical issues, our work may be delayed. Similarly, if a third-party service is temporarily or permanently unavailable, certain aspects of our service may be paused or adjusted. We will do our best to adapt and will communicate with clients about any material impacts, but we cannot be held liable for interruptions caused by external services.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    In summary, while we leverage third-party platforms to execute reputation management strategies, RepProtector does not guarantee the behavior or cooperation of any external platform. Our SLA and service commitments are made with the assumption that these platforms are functioning normally and are receptive to requests. When they are not, it may affect what we can achieve, and we appreciate your understanding of these inherent dependencies.

                    6. Outcome Expectations and No Guaranteed Results
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Online reputation management is a complex process influenced by numerous external factors. RepProtector does not guarantee specific outcomes or permanent results, and we want to be clear and upfront about this. We commit to putting forth our best effort, expertise, and industry best practices to improve your online reputation, but because many elements are beyond our control (as noted above), it would be unethical and impractical to promise a particular result. Here&apos;s what you should know:
                </p>
                <ul className="text-gray-700 list-inside list-disc [&>li]:pl-6 [&>li]:-indent-6">
                    <li>
                        No Guaranteed Removals: We cannot guarantee the removal or deletion of every negative review, article, comment, or other content about you or your business. While we have experience and tools to attempt removals or suppressions (such as negotiating with content owners or utilizing platform reporting mechanisms), the outcome is ultimately determined by the third-party platform or content owner. Some content may simply not be removable by legal or technical means if it does not violate any policies or laws.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        No Promised Rankings or Positive Content Placement: We do not promise that our work will achieve a specific search engine ranking or a fixed placement of positive content. For instance, we cannot assure that a positive article will rank #1 on Google or that a negative result will be completely pushed off the first page. Search engine results can fluctuate over time, and algorithms are outside our control. Our approach is to steadily improve your online presence, but it&apos;s not possible to guarantee exact positions or visibility levels.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Variable Results: Every case is unique. Factors such as the severity of existing negative content, the competitive landscape of your industry online, and how quickly positive content can be created or promoted will influence outcomes. As a result, one client&apos;s results may differ from another&apos;s. Any examples of past successes or timeframes we discuss are illustrative and not a guarantee that the same will occur for you.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    By setting these expectations, we aim to be transparent and honest. We avoid overpromising because your trust is important to us. Rest assured, RepProtector will work diligently to achieve the best possible results for your situation. We will provide regular updates on progress and adjust strategies as needed to pursue your goals. However, because the internet is an open ecosystem, no reputation management company can guarantee a specific outcome, and we caution clients to be wary of any such promises from any provider.

                    7. Missed Timelines, Credits, and Refunds
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Because our service delivery timelines are estimates and outcomes cannot be guaranteed, RepProtector does not provide automatic credits or refunds if a timeline is missed or a desired result is not achieved. In the event that we do not meet an agreed-upon estimated timeline, we will communicate the reasons for the delay and work with you to adjust the plan. However, delayed delivery on its own does not entitle a client to a refund or service credit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All remedies for unmet timelines or unsatisfactory outcomes are provided solely at our discretion. This means any accommodation – such as extending the service period, providing additional services at no charge, or partial refunds – may be considered by RepProtector on a case-by-case basis, but we are not obligated to offer these. Our policy is that we will evaluate the circumstances fairly and work with the client to find a reasonable solution if we fall significantly short of our commitments. The absence of a guarantee on timelines or outcomes is factored into our service pricing and agreements.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-[2.5rem]">
                    By engaging RepProtector, you acknowledge that the fees paid are for our expertise and effort in attempting to improve your online reputation, not for a guaranteed result. We believe in providing value through diligent work, and we will always strive to deliver results that meet or exceed your expectations. If you have concerns about any aspect of our service delivery, we encourage you to discuss them with us. Open communication can often resolve issues without the need for remedial measures.
