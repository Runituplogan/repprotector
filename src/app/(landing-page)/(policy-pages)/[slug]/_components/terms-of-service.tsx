        </h3>
        <p>
          RepProtector offers online reputation management services designed to help protect and improve your or your business's online reputation (the "Services"). Our Services include, for example, assisting in addressing negative or invalid online reviews by identifying, reviewing, and challenging feedback that violates platform guidelines. We may also provide services such as responding to customer feedback and other related reputation improvement strategies, as described on our Site. No user account is required to purchase our Services – you can order services directly through the Site. Please refer to our Site for specific descriptions and pricing of each Service offering. We reserve the right to modify or update the scope and description of our Services from time to time to reflect changes in offerings, features, or legal requirements. Any such modifications will not affect services already purchased, except as agreed or required by law.

          4. Payment Terms
        </h3>
        <p>All purchases of our Services must be paid in full at the time of order, and you agree to the following payment terms:</p>
        <ul className="text-gray-700 list-inside list-disc [&>li]:pl-6 [&>li]:-indent-6">
          <li>
            Third-Party Payment Processor: Payments are processed securely through our third-party payment processor, Stripe. We do not collect or store your credit card information on our servers; all payment details are handled by Stripe in accordance with their security protocols. By making a purchase, you authorize Stripe to charge the payment method you provide for the total amount due.
          </li>
          <li>
            One-Time Charges: Each service purchase is a one-time, non-recurring charge. There are no ongoing subscription fees for our Services. The price for each Service will be clearly indicated on the Site at the time of purchase (in U.S. Dollars, unless otherwise stated). You are responsible for providing valid payment information and ensuring sufficient funds or credit for the transaction.
          </li>
          <li>
            Taxes: Listed fees for Services do not include any applicable taxes or governmental charges, unless otherwise noted. If any such taxes or charges apply, you are responsible for paying them (except for taxes on our income).
          </li>
          <li>
            Order Confirmation: After payment, you should receive an electronic confirmation (such as an email or receipt page) summarizing your order details. This confirmation does not signify acceptance of your order; we reserve the right to decline or cancel any order if, for example, payment cannot be processed or we suspect fraud or misuse. In the rare case we need to cancel your order after payment, we will notify you and provide a full refund if your payment was already processed.

          5. Refund Policy
        </h3>
        <p>
          All sales of Services are final. Due to the nature of our reputation management services (which involve immediate work on your behalf), we do not offer routine refunds once a purchase is completed. By purchasing a service, you acknowledge that all fees are non-refundable. In rare or exceptional circumstances, we may, at our sole discretion, consider a refund or partial refund (for example, if we determine we cannot deliver the service as described). Any approved refunds would be issued to the original payment method, minus any non-recoverable transaction fees, if applicable. This Refund Policy does not limit any rights you may have under law – if applicable law requires a refund or cancellation right (such as for certain consumer transactions), we will honor such requirements. If you believe you are entitled to a refund under this policy or applicable law, please contact us at the email provided in the Contact section below with your order details and reason for the request. We will review requests in good faith, but the decision to grant a refund (unless required by law) is entirely ours.

          6. Disclaimer of Warranties
        </h3>
        <p>
          RepProtector provides the Site and Services on an "as is" and "as available" basis, without any warranties of any kind, either express or implied. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we expressly disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement. We do not guarantee that the Site or Services will meet your requirements, achieve any specific results, or be uninterrupted, error-free, secure, or free of viruses or other harmful components. Any information or advice obtained from us or through the Site does not create any warranty not expressly stated in these Terms. You assume all risk for any use of the Site and Services. If you are dissatisfied with the Site or our Services, your sole remedy is to discontinue use of the Site and Services.

          7. No Guarantee of Results
        </h3>
        <p>
          You understand and agree that RepProtector makes no guarantee or promise regarding specific outcomes from our Services. Online reputation management involves third-party platforms (such as review sites, search engines, and social media platforms) that we do not control. We do not guarantee the removal or alteration of any specific piece of content, improvement in search engine rankings, or any particular change in your online reputation. While we will perform our services with reasonable care, skill, and industry best practices, the success of any reputation management effort can vary and depends on factors beyond our control (for example, the policies and decisions of third-party websites). Accordingly, except as expressly provided in a separate written agreement, no outcome (such as complete removal of a negative review or a specific increase in positive content) is guaranteed.

          8. Limitation of Liability
        </h3>
        <p>
          To the maximum extent permitted by law, RepProtector and its owners, employees, and agents shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages whatsoever arising out of or in connection with your use of (or inability to use) the Site or Services. This limitation of liability applies to all types of claims, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), or any other legal theory, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. This means we are not responsible for losses such as (but not limited to) lost profits or revenue, loss of data, loss of goodwill or reputation, or the cost of obtaining substitute services, arising from or related to our Services.
        </p>
        <p>
          In no event shall our total cumulative liability to you for any claims arising out of or relating to the Services or these Terms exceed the amount you paid to us for the specific Service in question. If the claim involves multiple services or an ongoing series of services, our total liability shall not exceed the aggregate fees you paid to us in the twelve (12) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim (or, if shorter, the duration of your use of our Services). The existence of multiple claims will not enlarge this limit. You acknowledge that the pricing of our services reflects this allocation of risk and the limitation of liability specified herein.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation/exclusion of liability for certain types of damages. Accordingly, some of the above disclaimers and limitations may not apply to you to the extent prohibited by law. In such cases, our liability will be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

        </h3>
        <p>
          You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless RepProtector and its affiliates, owners, officers, employees, and agents from and against any and all claims, demands, lawsuits, damages, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or related to: (a) your use or misuse of the Site or Services; (b) any information or content you provide to us in the course of using our Services; (c) your breach of these Terms; or (d) your violation of any law or the rights of any third party. This means that if a third party (for example, a review platform, a customer, or any other person) brings a claim against us due to your actions, omissions, or content (including, but not limited to, claims that content you asked us to challenge or remove was lawful or did not violate anyone's rights), you will be responsible for all costs and damages we incur (including legal fees and expenses) in connection with such claim. We reserve the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, and you agree to cooperate with our defense of such claim. Your indemnification obligations will survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.

You agree that any legal action or proceeding arising under or relating to this Agreement shall be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in the State of Tennessee, and preferably in courts of competent jurisdiction located in Davidson County, Tennessee.
