          1. Introduction
        </h3>
        <p>
          RepProtector ("we," "us," or "our") uses cookies and similar tracking technologies on our website to improve your browsing experience and analyze site traffic. We do not use cookies for advertising or marketing purposes – only for essential site functionality and basic analytics. This Cookie Policy explains what cookies are, which types we use, how you can control them, and provides a note for international users. By using our website, you agree to our use of cookies.

          2. What Are Cookies?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Cookies are small text files that websites store on your device when you visit. These files contain a modest amount of data and are used for various purposes. For example, cookies help websites function properly, make the site more secure, provide a better user experience, and allow site owners to understand how the website is performing and where it needs improvement. Cookies generally do not contain any personally identifying information on their own, and many are automatically deleted when you close your browser (these are "session cookies"), while others may remain longer until they expire or you delete them ("persistent cookies").

          3. Types of Cookies We Use
        </h3>
        <p>Our site uses cookies that fall into two basic categories – Essential Cookies and Analytics Cookies. We do not use any cookies beyond these two types.</p>
        <ul className="text-gray-700 list-inside list-disc [&>li]:pl-6 [&>li]:-indent-6">
          <li>
            Essential Cookies: These cookies are strictly necessary for our website to function correctly. They enable core features such as security, network management, and basic accessibility of the site (for example, remembering that you are logged in or enabling you to navigate pages). Essential cookies do not typically collect any personal information about you and are often set to ensure the website works as intended. Because these cookies are necessary for the operation of the site, they can usually be placed without user consent under laws like the GDPR.
          </li>
          <li>
            Analytics Cookies: These cookies help us understand how visitors use our website so we can improve it over time. Analytics cookies track information such as which pages are visited, how long users stay on a page, and how users interact with our site's content. We use Google Analytics (a trusted third-party analytics service) for this purpose. Google Analytics sets cookies (for instance, the _ga cookie) to collect website usage statistics without personally identifying individual visitors. The data collected is aggregated and helps us measure things like overall visitor count and usage patterns. The _ga cookie, for example, distinguishes unique visitors and typically remains on your browser for about two years. While analytics cookies are very useful for improving our services and understanding user needs, they are not essential for basic site functionality.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Note: We do not use any advertising, targeting, or marketing cookies on our site. Advertising cookies (also known as marketing or tracking cookies) are typically used to create profiles of users or to deliver personalized ads by tracking your behavior across websites. Since we do not serve ads or engage in behavioral profiling, such cookies are not employed by RepProtector.

          4. How You Can Control Cookies
        </h3>
        <p>You have several options to manage or limit how cookies are used when you visit our site:</p>
        <ul className="text-gray-700 list-inside list-disc [&>li]:pl-6 [&>li]:-indent-6">
          <li>
            Browser Settings: Most web browsers allow you to control cookies through the browser's settings. For example, you can typically view which cookies are stored on your device and delete them individually, block third-party cookies (or even all cookies), and set preferences for certain websites. Please note that if you disable or block certain cookies (especially essential cookies), some parts of our website may not function properly or your user experience may be affected.
          </li>
          <li>
            Google Analytics Opt-Out: If you wish to opt out of our analytics tracking, Google offers an official Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on. By installing this add-on in your browser, you can prevent Google Analytics from collecting information about your website visits. This tool tells the Google Analytics script not to share your visit data, allowing you to browse without contributing to analytics statistics. (Keep in mind this opt-out applies only to Google Analytics and does not affect other types of cookies.)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Aside from the above, if our site introduces any cookie preference tools or consent banners in the future, you could use those to manage your cookie choices. For now, your continued use of our site indicates your consent to the placement of the essential and analytics cookies described in this policy. If you do not wish to accept these cookies, please consider adjusting your browser settings accordingly.

          5. International Users
        </h3>
        <p>
          Our website is operated from and hosted in the United States, and our cookie practices primarily follow U.S. regulations. If you are accessing RepProtector from outside the U.S., please be aware that any information collected through cookies will be transferred to and processed in the United States. By using our site from an international location, you are consenting to the transfer of your information to the U.S. and to the application of United States law for our handling of cookies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users from the European Union, United Kingdom, or other regions with strict privacy laws should note that our approach to cookies may differ from the requirements of your local laws. Under EU law (such as the ePrivacy Directive and GDPR), websites are generally required to inform users about any cookies, obtain consent before setting non-essential cookies, and provide an opt-out for those cookies. RepProtector's audience is primarily U.S.-based, and we do not currently display a cookie consent banner or pop-up. Instead, we provide this detailed Cookie Policy to inform all users of our cookie use. By continuing to use our site without blocking cookies, you indicate your consent to our use of the limited essential and analytics cookies described above. If you are an international user who does not wish to have analytics cookies placed on your device, you may opt out as described (for example, using browser settings or the Google Analytics opt-out addon) or refrain from using our site.
        </p>
        <p>
          We strive to respect privacy principles globally. Should international legal requirements change or if our service begins to cater more to non-U.S. users, we may implement additional cookie consent measures to comply with those laws. We encourage all users to familiarize themselves with their local cookie regulations and to use the control options available to them to meet their preferences.
